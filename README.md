# Flower Labelling 

This project uses deep learning to label flowers in images.

## Project Status
The project is currently in the [active/on-hold/completed] state.

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to develop a deep learning model that can accurately label flowers in images. The model will be trained on a dataset of flower images that have been manually labeled. The model will then be evaluated on a test set of images to measure its accuracy.

## Methods Used
The following methods will be used in this project:
1. Data collection and preparation
2. Model training
3. Model evaluation
4. Technologies

## The following technologies will be used in this project:
1. Python
2. TensorFlow
3. Keras
4. NumPy
5. Pandas

## Project Description
The project will use the following steps to develop a deep learning model that can accurately label flowers in images:
1. Collect a dataset of flower images that have been manually labeled.
2. Prepare the data by resizing the images and converting them to a format that can be used by the deep learning model.
3. Train the model using a supervised learning algorithm.
4. Evaluate the model on a test set of images.
4. Improve the model by adjusting the hyperparameters or training on a larger dataset.

## Needs of this project
The project needs the following:
1. A dataset of flower images that have been manually labeled.
2. A computer with a GPU.
3. A deep learning framework, such as TensorFlow or Keras.
